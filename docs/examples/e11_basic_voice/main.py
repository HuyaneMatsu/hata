# This example shows basic interaction with voice channels.
# We can join `VoiceClient`-s to them and play or capture audio.
#
# We're using `commands_v2` extension since it provides an easy API to access user voice state or the local voice client
#
# The example will showcase the following actions:
# => Connecting to voice channel.
# => Changing volume.
# => Playing audio from youtube.
# => Disconnecting.
