# Hata basics

Similarly to other wrappers, Hata uses asynchronous environment.

Lets continue with a simple example and then explain what happens.

## Basic client example

```py
from hata import Client, start_clients

TOKEN = ''
NekoBot = Client(TOKEN)


@NekoBot.events
async def ready(client):
    print(f'{client.full_name} ({client.id}) logged in')


@NekoBot.events
async def message_create(client, message):
    """Simple reply functionality based on message content."""
    if message.author.is_bot:
        return  # We will ignore messages from bot accounts

    lowercase_content = message.content.lower()

    if lowercase_content in ('owo', 'uwu', '0w0'):
        await client.message_create(message.channel, lowercase_content)

    elif lowercase_content.startswith('ayy'):
        await client.message_create(message.channel, 'lmao')


start_clients()

```

1.: We import `Client` and `start_clients` from the library.
If you get `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError` then the library is not correctly installed.

2.: We define our TOKEN, which is a string.
You can get one by registering your Bot with [Discord's application page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)

**Note:** In Discord application page please check both `presence intent` and `server member` intent under 
"Bot/Privileged Gateway Intents" section. Intents are too broad for basic example but you can read more here [Intents](#Intents).

3.: We create our `Client` instance and name it `NekoBot`. 
When creating it we need to pass at least a token but it accepts [other, optional, attributes too.](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/blob/0695fd613d76390c8668851631accc473031cc5c/hata/discord/client.py#L607)

4.: We can use decorators on our client and here we use `@NekoBot.events` because our client is  named `NekoBot`.
In this case our decorator will capture `ready` event and handle it in `async def ready(client):` function.

The `ready` event will be activated after the client finished logging in to Discord.
When it happens, in the example above, we print out the client's full name and it's ID.

Event function can take multiple arguments depending on the event, but all of them take `client` as the first one.
The example we used is the most straightforward way but there are multiple ways of adding event handlers and there
are multiple events that you can register. You can read about this [Event Examples](#Event-examples).

5.: The `message_create` is called every time the client receives a message.
It is triggered by bot messages as well, so first of all we want to filter them out.
Then we lowercase the message content (message.content is the text of the message) and check if it contains certain words.
Functionality is simple, if someone writes either `owo`, `uwu` or `0w0` the bot will reply with the same message.
And if someone writes message that starts with `ayy` the bot will reply with `lmao`.

6.: At the end we run up our client(s) with calling the `start_clients` function.
This line will block until the client(s) successfully login, then it will return either True or False depending on success.
If your bot fails to login because of bad intents read point 2 again.

## Event examples

There are multiple events you can register,
you can take a look [here](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/blob/0695fd613d76390c8668851631accc473031cc5c/hata/discord/parsers.py#L6011) to see all events.

You can register a event,  if you wish, in multiple ways so here are some examples:

This should be the most straightforward way:
```py
@NekoBot.events
async def emoji_create(client, emoji):
    pass
```

Above is the same as doing:

```py
async def emoji_create(client, emoji):
    pass

NekoBot.events(emoji_create)
```

Using a different name:

```py
async def random_name(client, emoji):
    pass

NekoBot.events(random_name, name='emoji_create')
```


```py
@NekoBot.events(name='emoji_create')
async def random_name(client, emoji):
    pass
```

There are other cases as well, but these should be enough for now.

When you add event handler the type and arg-count will be checked, so whenever you
would mess something up it will raise an exception like:

- `ValueError: Events must be coroutine functions!`
- `ValueError: Invalid argcount, expected 2, got 1.`
- `LookupError: Invalid Event name: 'owowhatsthis'.`

Examples for the above errors:

- `ValueError: Events must be coroutine functions!`
   Our function is not a coroutine, it is missing 'async' keyword to it.
    ```py
    @NekoBot.events
    def emoji_create(client, emoji):
        pass
    ```

- `ValueError: Invalid argcount, expected 2, got 1.`
   Our function took to many/little arguments.
    ```py
    # emoji_create should take 2 arguments, client and emoji
    @NekoBot.events
    async def emoji_create(client):
        pass
    ```

- `LookupError: Invalid Event name: 'owowhatsthis'.`
   We're trying to register a event that does not exist.
    ```py
    @NekoBot.events
    async def owowhatsthis(client):
        pass
    ```

## Intents

When you are creating your Discord bot in Discord application page you can check certain intents.
Intents are basically certain permissions your bot is asking from Discord to do certain things (see member list, member
statuses etc). If your bot needs certain intents but you did not check those intents in application page
the bot will fail to login when you run the code.

When you define the Hata client default value of `intents` is `-1` which means ALL intents, so it **will** fail to
login if you did not check both `presence intent` and `server member` intent in application page.

But you don't have to use the default value, you can use only intents you wish, so for example 
`NekoBot = Client(TOKEN)` can be replaced with `NekoBot = Client(TOKEN, intents=int('1000000000', 2))`
in [Basic client example](#Basic-client-example) since that code only requires `IntentFlag` of 9 which is required for 
sending messages (and in that code we only need to send messages since it's a simple replying bot).
By specifying specific intent like that we don't have to check intents in application page and it will save our
resources as member lists, statuses etc will not be loaded.

You can read more about IntentFlags and which values represent what [here](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/blob/0695fd613d76390c8668851631accc473031cc5c/hata/discord/parsers.py#L204)
(note that not all of IntentFlags require permissions from Discord, some are managed internally by Hata).

**If you are beginner** it is recommended to use default value of ALL intents and check all intents in Discord application
page (same how it's done in [Basic client example](#Basic-client-example)) so you don't have to bother with those
until you are more experienced.

You can read more about intents here [Discord blog](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412)

#### Multiple flags in intents

If you'd like to have multiple IntentFlags example 1,4 and 9 then you would do `int('1000010010', 2)` which is just
a binary number and 1s represent which IntentFlags you want. 

## Formatting objects

A lot of hata's built-in types have formatting support.
Lets take `User` object that has name=test and discriminator=0007 as an example.

We can format it, for example, with an f-string: `print(f'{user:f}')`
which would result in `test#0007`

You can use these format codes:
- `f` format code means full name, so name with discriminator.
- `m` format code stands for mention.
- `c` format code stands for the creation date when the user was created.
- no format code is only the user name.

> `Client` instances are valid users too and they support the same formatting codes as well.

Note that you can also use object attributes too, in the case of `User` you would be able to use

- `.name`
- `.full_name`
- `.mention`
- `.created_at`
- etc

You should look up attributes for the object you're using to know more about them.
For now you can look trough the code or, while in our support Discord server, use command:
`&docs WHAT_TO_SERACH_FOR` specific example would be `&docs User`
