# class `EventDescriptor`

After we get a dispatch event from Discord, it's parser might ensure an
event. These events are stored as instance attributes at an
`EventDescriptor` objects. All of these events should return an
awaitable object.

- Source : [parsers.py](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/blob/master/hata/parsers.py)

## All method

### `__init__(self)`

`EventDescriptor` is created at `Client.__init__` with no instance
attributes at all. These are filled up by the user, or when
`Client.connect` is called.

### `__call__(self,func=None,name=None,pass_content=False,case=None,overwrite=False)`

- returns : `callable`

The main reason why we can use `EventDescriptor` with `@` is of cource
it is the `__call__` method. But this method does way more as you would
suspect on first look.

Additionally this method returns the added object on success.

### `clear(self)`

- returns : `None`

Cleares the `EventDescriptor`, to the same state as it were just created.

#### First case:

The general usage is when you add just an event:

```py
async def coroutine_function(self,*args):
    pass

client.events(coroutine_function)

# is same as

@client.events
async def coroutine_function(self,*args):
    pass

# even this works:

@client.events()
async def coroutine_function(self,*args):
    pass

# if you add more events, all will be called, except if you pass `overwrite`
# as True, because at that case the old one will be replaced.

@client.events(overwrite=True)
async def coroutine_function(self,*args):
    pass
```

If you add a coroutine function it will get the event's name by default.
If the name is incorrect raises an exception as expected. Then will check
how much arguments the parser passes when the event is called. If the
argument number is incorrect will raise an exception too. If your function
accepts `*args`, then argument count will be ignored as expected.

But actually you dont really need to pass a `coroutine function`, It can
be a callable object too with async `__call__`. If the object has
`__async_call__` attribute, then even the async check will be ignored.
It is a usefull option, if you just want to return an awaitable.

But you can even pass just a `type` instance itself too, at that case
every check is same as above, but a difference is, that it will initialize
it.

#### Second case:

When you pass a name:
    
```py
@client.events(name='gift_update')
async def coroutine_function(self,*args):
    pass

# Or you can do:
client.events(coroutine_function, name='example')
```

At this case instead of checking the object's name it will use the passed
name instead. But there are other ways too, to pass name. One of them if
you pass an object with a `__name__` (function name check mimic) instance
attribute, or when you pass an object with an `__event_name__` attribute.

#### Third case:

When you pass a `pass_to_event=True` and an optional `case`.

```py
client.events(coroutine_function, name='example', pass_to_event=True)
client.events(coroutine_function, name='example', pass_to_event=True, case='owo')
```

At these cases instead of setting an event to the `client.events` it will
call:

```py
client.event.<name>.__setevent__(func,case)
```

If `case` is `None` it will try to get case on the same way as we get the
`name` above.

Using this option we can get an additional `ValueError` if we did not pass
a `name` argument or an `AttributeError` if the event is not implemented
yet or if it has no `__setevent__` method.

## Events

Additional information:
- All item in `old` arguements is optional, but it contains at least one.
- All event is called as method from the [client](Client.md), so the client is
always passed as first argument.

### `achievement(client,data)`

Called when one of the [client](Client.md)'s [achievement](Achievement.md)
changes. Becase I have no idea what type of data Discord sends, it just passes
everything.

### `channel_create(client,channel)`

Called when a [channel](CHANNEL_TYPES.md) is created.
(Private channels are created only once too).

### `channel_delete(client,channel)`

Called when a [channel](CHANNEL_TYPES.md) is deleted.

### `channel_edit(client,channel,old)`

Called when a channel](CHANNEL_TYPES.md) is edited. The `old` argument is a `dict`
of the changed attributes, what contains (`attribute name`, `old value`) items.

### `embed_update(client,message,result)`

Called when only message's embeds are updated and the message is not edited.
The `result` can be:
 - `0` if no update took place.
 - `1` if sizes are updated.
 - `2` if embed links are added
 - `3` if the message's embeds are suppressed, but an unsuppressed embed is
added to it. Discord bug, happens when you update an embed, what is
suppressed, but instead of desuppressing and updating, it removes the old embeds
and adds new one to it. The message's flag will still show that the it's embeds
are suppressed.

### `emoji_create(client,guild,emoji)`

Called, when an [emoji](Emoji.md) is created at a [guild](Guild.md).

### `emoji_delete(client,guild,emoji)`

Called, when an [emoji](Emoji.md) is deleted at a [guild](Guild.md).

> Deleted emojis's [`.guild`](Emoji.md#guild) attribute is set to `None`.

### `emoji_edit(client,guild,emoji,old)`

Called when an [emoji](Emoji.md) is edited at a [guild](Guild.md). The `old`
argument is a `dict` of the changed attributes, what contains (`attribute name`,
`old value`) items.

| name                      | description                   |

| require_colons            | bool                          |
| roles                     | set of [Role](Role.md) / None |

> If an [emoji](Emoji.md) is upated it's `.user` instance attribute might be
> set too.

### `error(client,event,err)`

Called when an unexpected error happens. Mostly the user itself should define
where it is called, because it is not Discord event bound, but an internal
event.

The `event` argument should be a `str` what tell where the error occured,
and `err` should be an `Exception` or an error message (so preferably `str`).

This event has a default dispatcher called `default_error_event`, what
writes an error message to `file=sys.stderr`.

### `gift_update(client,channel,gift)`

Called when a [gift](Gift.md) code is sent to a [channel](CHANNEL_TYPES.md)
what the client sees.

### `guild_ban_add(client,guild,user)`

Called when a [user](User.md) is banned from a [guild](Guild.md).

### `guild_ban_delete(client,guild,user)`

Called when a [user](User.md) is unbanned at a [guild](Guild.md).

### `guild_create(client,guild)`

Called when the [client](Client.md) joins or creates a [guild](Guild.md).

### `guild_delete(client,guild,profile)`

Called when the [guild](Guild.md) is deleted or just the [client](Client.md)
left (got kicked or banned too) from it. The `profile` is the
[`GuildProfile`](GuildProfile.md) of the client there.

### `guild_edit(client,guild,old)`

Called when a [guild](Guild.md) is edited. The `old` argument is a `dict`
of the changed attributes, what contains (`attribute name`, `old value`) items.

### `guild_user_chunk(client,guild,collected)`

Called when a chunk of [users](User.md) is receaved from a [guild](Guild.md).
Used only at the case of `large` guilds. Also this event plays a big role when
logging in, because it delays the ready state, till we get all the user chunks.

This event has a default dispatcher called `ChunkQueue`. Overwriting it is
not recommended.

### `guild_user_delete(client,guild,user,profile)`

Called when a [User](User.md) left (kick and ban counts too) from [guild](Guild.md).
The `profile` is the [`GuildProfile`](GuildProfile.md) of the user at guild.

### `integration_update(client,guild)`

Called when an [integration](Integration.md) of a [guild](Guild.md) is updated.
Sadly Discord does not sends details, so we pass only the guild as argument.

[text channels](ChannelTextBase.md).

### `message_delete_multyple(client,channel,messages,message_ids)`

messages, what got deleted and the `message_ids` arguent is a list of all the
message's id-s, independently if they are loaded or not.

### `message_edit(client,message,old)`

Called when a loaded [message](Message.md) is edited. The `old` argument is a
`dict` of the changed attributes, what contains (`attribute name`, `old value`)
items. A special case is if a message is (un)pinned or (un)suppressed , because
then the `old` is not going to contain `'edited'`, only `'pinned'` or `flags`.

## Magic methods

### `__setatrr__`

If an event is set of any clients, what is not `DEFAULT_EVENT`,
then the event's parser will switch from `OPT` to the normal one, which means,
it will calculate changes to feed the event with and also will start to ensuring
the event too.

### `__delattr__`

Removes the event with switching it to `DEFAULT_EVENT`.
If non of the clients have this event set, then it switches the
event's parser to `OPT`.
