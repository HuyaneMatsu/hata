# Introduction

As your bot grows you'll probably want to split code into multiple files to improve readability and extendability.

Hata offers you a solution called plugin loading.

Plugins can be plugged in and out, allowing your application to be more modular.

The main aim of Hata's plugin loader is to preserve traditional code flow inside of plugins without introducing weird
top level classes.

Support for single client applications was a significant factor under consideration while designing this system.
The concept is based on presetting variables before the module is executing, but more about this later.

# Getting started

To get started we need a few plugins. These can be either files or directories.
To use them first we will register and then load them.

```py
from hata.ext.plugin_loader import register_plugin, load_plugin

register_plugin('directory')
load_plugin('directory')
```

Or there is a shortcut function for all of this:

```py
from hata.ext.plugin_loader import register_and_load_plugin

register_and_load_plugin('plugins')
```

## Presetting variables

As mentioned in the introduction, the plugin loader is based on setting variables before the module is executed.
You can set these variables by using the `add_default_plugin_variables` function.

```py
from hata import Client
from hata.ext.plugin_loader import add_default_plugin_variables, register_and_load_plugin


my_beloved_bot = Client(...)

add_default_plugin_variables(my_beloved_bot=my_beloved_bot)

register_and_load_plugin('plugin')
```

**plugin.py**
```py
@my_beloved_bot.events
async def launch(client):
    print(f'{client} launched!')

@my_beloved_bot.events
async def ready(client):
    print(f'{client} is ready!')
```

All added *default* variables will show up in all files (there's an option to turn this off per file).

You can also define file specific variables.
To do this, pass additional keyword variables when registering the plugin, e.g.:

```py
register_and_load_plugin('plugin', add_launch_event_handler=False)
```

Important note: these plugin-specific variables won't show up in sub-modules imported from that file.

### Linter confusion

These variables might confuse linters. To help them out, you can annotate them.

```py
from hata import Client

my_beloved_bot: Client
```

After this the linter will see that `my_beloved_bot` is indeed a `Client`, but "it might not be defined" still.

Hata ignores these annotations, they are completely up to you.

## Setup & Teardown

Not every change can be tracked within a plugin, sometimes you might want to access resources,
which are actively used while the bot is running.
Another case is when you want to make other changes to the application outside the tracked scope.

In these cases you might want to use the `setup` and the `teardown` functions.

```py
def setup(module):
    # allocate resources
    ...

def teardown(module):
    # un-allocate resources
    ...
```

The plugin's body runs inside an executor, allowing blocking tasks to be executed.
But the setup & teardown functions always **run on the event loop** meaning they can be *async* as well, but they should
**not contain blocking** operations.

## Registering rules

When registering a plugin, multiple preference rules are applied:

1. If the plugin name refers to a file, load it.
    
    ```
    /plugins.py
    ```
    
2. If the plugin is a directory, load all files from it.
    
    ```
    /plugins/file_1.py
    /plugins/file_2.py
    ```

3. If a directory has an `__init__.py` file, will load only that file from the directory.
    
    ```
    /plugins/__init__.py
    /plugins/file_1.py                          <- this wont be registered.
    /plugins/file_2.py                          <- this wont be registered.
    ```

4. Apply recursive loading on directories without `__init__.py` file.

    ```
    /plugins/file_1.py
    /plugins/file_2.py
    
    /plugins/directory_1/__init__.py
    /plugins/diretcory_1/file_3.py              <- `__init__.py` rule: this wont be registered.
    /plugins/diretcory_1/directory_n/file_n.py  <- `__init__.py` rule: this wont be registered.
    
    /plugins/directory_2/file_4.py
    /plugins/diretcory_2/file_5.py
    ```


## Directory based plugins

As mentioned above if a directory has an `__init__.py` then only that file will be loaded.
Although when a plugin's **sub-module is imported** the file will be automatically registered as a plugin as well.
This becomes really handy when dealing with bigger (multi-file) commands.

### Plugin trees

By importing a plugin from another one, a plugin tree is built internally. These trees can be used to decide which
files should be grouped together when unloading / reloading plugins.

As an example:

```
/file_1.py
/file_2.py
```

If `file_1.py` imports from `file_2.py` then the two files will be linked together and, by default, when any of them is
reloaded, both will be.

### Sub module trees

Sub-module trees are applied to directories which have an `__init__.py` files in them.
They can be either weak or strong sub-module trees.

### Strong sub-module trees

Strong sub-module trees can be handy when dealing with a command with sub-commands.

Imagine that each sub-command has its own file.

```py
/__init__.py
sub_command_1.py
sub_command_2.py
sub_command_3.py
```

To build a command, you might do something like:

**\_\_init\_\_.py**
```py
from . import sub_command_1
from . import sub_command_2
from . import sub_command_3

main_command = ...

for module in (sub_command_1, sub_command_2, sub_command_3):
    sub_command = getattr(sub_command_1, sub_command_1.__all__[0])
    main_command.add_sub_command(sub_command)

```

**sub_command_1.py**
```py
__all__ = ('add', )

async def add(...):
    """Adds a new plum to the basket."""
    ...
```

> This is just an example you can do it completely differently.


### Weak sub-module trees

This case occurs when not every module relies on each other inside a directory. To build a weak sub-module tree,
you need to import only the module itself and no values from it.

- Correct example:

    **\_\_init\_\_.py**
    ```py
    from . import file_1
    ```
    
    You can also use `import *`, if the file has empty `__all__` defined.
    
    **\_\_init\_\_.py**
    ```py
    from file_1 import *
  
    __all__ = ()
    ```
    
    **file_1.py**
    ```py
    __all__ = ()
    ```
    
    > I recommend adding `__all__ = ()` to every file which should be weakly bound. It makes it more stupid-proof.

- Bad example

    **\_\_init\_\_.py**
    ```py
    from file_1 import command
    ```
    
    A weird case might be when you just want to access a sub-module value, but accessing an attribute like this is
    same as directly importing it!
    
    **\_\_init\_\_.py**
    ```py
    from . import file_1
    command = file_1.command
    ```

# API

The plugin loader offers a function and a more object-oriented API. They do the same mostly... the functional API
offers a few extra utility functions.

Here is a full list of the offered functionalities:

| Functional                        | Object oriented                           | Description                                                                |

# Something is going way wrong a.k.a. how can things derp out on the most unexpected ways!

## Deadlock

Yupp, there can be deadlock, but when and why is more interesting!

We will go from top to bottom to find out what is happening and how to solve it.

- **The issue**
  
    When importing a plugin from another, the native `import` hooks might lock code execution when the control is
    given back to the source file.
    
    **/plugins/file_1.py**
    ```py
    # Before import everything is fine
    
    from .file_2 import something
        # file_2 runs, no problem. Executor opened and then left.
        # Everything is fine, importlibs returns the control.
    
    # random, probably C code runs
    # our code is frozen
    ```
    
    To solve this, you can use the `import_plugin` function, where this won't happen, because we never leave python
    lands.
    
    **/plugins/file_1.py**
    ```py
    from hata.ext.plugin_loader import import_plugin
    
    something = import_plugin('.file_2', 'something')
    ```

- **The black magic**
    
    This can only happen when calling `load_plugin` from **outside the main file**, as an example:
    
    **/main.py**
    ```py
    ...
    
    import bots
    
    ...  
    ```
    
    **/bots.py**
    ```py
    from hata.ext.plugin_loader import load_all_plugin
    
    ...
    
    load_all_plugin()
    ```
    
    To solve this move the function call to the main file :WHAT:
    
    **/main.py**
    ```py
    ...
    
    import hata
    
    import bots
    
    hata.ext.plugin_loader.load_all_plugin()
    
    ...
    ```
    
    **/bots.py**
    ```py
    ...
    ```

- **Welcome to HELL**
    
    This is not a python issue but, as weird as it might sound, an implementation one.
    
    ```sh
    $ python3 main.py
    ```
    
    This bug only occurs on Cpython. **Use pypy.**
    
    ```sh
    $ pypy3 main.py
    ```
      
    Problem solved.


## Random import error when using relative imports

When using relative imports to another plugin, something might derp out, and you can end up with a random import error.

- **The issue**
    
    Let's say our directory looks like:
    ```py
    /plugins/file_1.py
    /plugins/file_2.py
    /plugins/file_3.py
    ```
    
    We try to import `file_2.py` from `file_1.py` and the file cannot be resolved.
    
    **/plugins/file_1.py**
    ```py
    from . import file_2
    ```
    
    The plugin loader is smart enough to resolve this tho. Kinda weird.
    
    **/plugins/file_1.py**
    ```py
    from hata.ext.plugin_loader import import_plugin
    
    import_plugin('.file_2')
    ```

- **The reason**
    
    When doing relative imports, it is required to have an `__init__.py` in the directory. *The more you know*
    
    ```
    /plugins/__init__.py
    /plugins/file_1.py
    /plugins/file_2.py
    /plugins/file_3.py
    ```
    
    This produces a weird case when the plugin lookup is caught by the `__init__.py` file.
    To resolve this issue we can build a weak sub-module tree, like:
    
    **/plugins/\_\_init\_\_.py**
    ```py
    from . import file_1
    from . import file_2
    from . import file_3
    ```

- **Welcome to HELL**
    
    The *random* import error is again not a python error.
    
    To solve this, we will switch to pypy which will raise a `SystemError` instead with the details of what is happening
    telling you that you indeed need an `__init__.py` file.
