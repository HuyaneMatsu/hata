Hata is an async Discord API wrapper written in Python named after Hata no Kokoro.

If naming a Discord API wrapper after a Touhou character is not enough to convince you to try it, it has got some real
stuff:

- Fast and simple asynchronous framework to write concurrent code using async/await syntax, but also great for
    embedding into a threaded system.
- Usage of Privileged Intents
- Running more clients from the same instance.
- Shared entity cache between shards and clients.
- Feature rich API for common use cases.
- Fast rate limit handling.
- No more member objects associated with guilds, if there is a user in more guilds, then there is only ONE user.
- Optimized dispatch event events depending on intents, client count and on handled events as well.
- Option to disable user presences or even user caching, although disabling user cache is not recommended.
- Many builtin extension. Including a slash command one as well.
- Audio sending and receiving.
- Can interact with the Discord API without gateway connection.

Usage
-----

The following example answers on `ping` message.

```py
from hata import Client

Nue = Client('TOKEN')

@Nue.events
async def ready(client):
    print(f'{client:f} logged in.')

@Nue.events
async def message_create(client, message):
    if message.author.is_bot:
        return
    
    if message.content == 'ping':
        await client.message_create(message.channel, 'pong')

Nue.start()
```

An improved example using the `commands` extension to handle common use cases.

```py
from hata import Client

Saki = Client('TOKEN', extensions='commands', prefix='s!')

@Saki.events
async def ready(client):
    print(f'{client:f} logged in.')

@Saki.commands
async def ping(client, message):
    return 'pong'

Saki.start()
```

Or use slash commands!

```py
from hata import Client, Guild

GUILD = Guild.precreate(guild_id)

Seija = Client('TOKEN', extensions='slash')

@Seija.events
async def ready(client):
    print(f'{client:f} logged in.')

@Seija.interactions(guild=GUILD)
async def ping():
    \"\"\"ping-pong\"\"\"
    return 'pong'

Seija.start()
```

> Note: You need to restart your client, or the slash command wont show up. If there are more than 50 integrations
> (bots) in a guild, some of the (integrations) bots wont be able to use slash commands. This is currently a Discord
> limitation.

If you wonder, how to run up more clients, just put the two code snippet into the same file.

Hata leaves the main thread free, `client.start()` blocks it only till the client logs in (or fails it), although you
can still use the `start_clients` function, what as it says, starts up all the non-running clients parallelly, so go
ahead and start python with `-i` option, then interact with the clients from your interactive console in runtime.

We got some tutorials on `github:https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/tree/master/docs` as well, please check them too!
