    _gateway_url : `str`
        Cached up gateway url, what is invalidated after `1` minute. Used to avoid unnecessary requests when launching
        up more shards.
    _gateway_requesting : `bool`
        Whether the client already requests it's gateway.
    _gateway_time : `float`
        The last timestamp when ``._gateway_url`` was updated.
    _gateway_max_concurrency : `int`
        The max amount of shards, which can be launched at the same time.

        Creates a new ``Client`` instance with the given parameters.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        token : `str`
            A valid Discord token, what the client can use to interact with the Discord API.
        secret: `str`, optional
            Client secret used when interacting with oauth2 endpoints.
        client_id : `None`, `int` or `str`, Optional
            The client's `.id`. If passed as `str` will be converted to `int`. Defaults to `None`.
            
            When more `Client` is started up, it is recommended to define their id initially. The wrapper can detect the
            clients' id-s only when they are logging in, so the wrapper  needs to check if a ``User`` alter_ego of the
            client exists anywhere, and if does will replace it.
        application_id : `None`, `int` or `str`, Optional
            The client's application id. If passed as `str`, will be converted to `int`. Defaults to `None`.
        activity : ``ActivityBase``, optional
            The client's preferred activity.
        status : `str` or ``Status``, optional
            The client's preferred status.
        is_bot : `bool`, optional
            Whether the client is a bot user or a user account. Defaults to False.
        shard_count : `int`, optional
            The client's shard count. If passed as lower as the recommended one, will reshard itself.
        intents : ``IntentFlag``, optional
             By default the client will launch up using all the intent flags. Negative values will be interpreted as
             using all the intents, meanwhile if passed as positive, non existing intent flags are removed.
        **kwargs : keyword arguments
            Additional predefined attributes for the client.
        
        Other Parameters
        ----------------

            The client's ``.name``.
        discriminator : `int` or `str` instance, Optional
            The client's ``.discriminator``. Is accepted as `str` instance as well and will be converted to `int`.
        avatar : `None`, ``Icon`` or `str`, Optional
            The client's avatar. Mutually exclusive with `avatar_type` and `avatar_hash`.
        avatar_type : ``IconType``, Optional
            The client's avatar's type. Mutually exclusive with `avatar_type`.
        avatar_hash : `int`, Optional
            The client's avatar hash. Mutually exclusive with `avatar`.
        flags : ``UserFlag`` or `int` instance, Optional

        `0` (or later if needed) on close, instead of really closing instantly. These data types implement a

        If `allowed_mentions` is passed as `None`, then returns a `dict`, what will cause all mentions to be disabled.

        (any value from `('everyone', 'users', 'roles')`), ``UserBase`` or ``Role`` instances.
        
        Passing `everyone` will allow the message to mention `@everyone` (permissions can overwrite this behaviour).

        If the client has no `manage_messages` permission at the channel, then returns instantly.
        
        This method is a coroutine.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        channel : ``ChannelTextBase`` instance
            The channel, where the deletion should take place.
        after : `int`, ``DiscordEntity`` or `datetime`, Optional
            The timestamp after the messages were created, which will be deleted.
        before : `int`, ``DiscordEntity`` or `datetime`, Optional
            The timestamp before the messages were created, which will be deleted.
        limit : `int`, Optional
            The maximal amount of messages to delete.
        filter : `callable`, Optional
            A callable filter, what should accept a message object as argument and return either `True` or `False`.
        reason : `None` or `str`, Optional
            Shows up at the respective guild's audit logs.

        Deletes messages between an interval determined by `before` and `after`. They can be passed as `int`, or as
        a ``DiscordEntity`` instance or as a `datetime` object.
        
        Not like ``.message_delete_sequence``, this method uses up all he clients at the respective channel to delete
        messages an not only the one from what it was called from.
        
        If non of the clients have `manage_messages` permission, then returns instantly.
        
        This method is a coroutine.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        channel : ``ChannelTextBase`` instance
            The channel, where the deletion should take place.
        after : `int`, ``DiscordEntity`` or `datetime`, Optional
            The timestamp after the messages were created, which will be deleted.
        before : `int`, ``DiscordEntity`` or `datetime`, Optional
            The timestamp before the messages were created, which will be deleted.
        limit : `int`, Optional
            The maximal amount of messages to delete.
        filter : `callable`, Optional
            A callable filter, what should accept a message object as argument and return either `True` or `False`.
        reason : `None` or `str`, Optional
            Shows up at the respective guild's audit logs.
        
        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If `after` or `before` was passed with an unexpected type.
        ConnectionError
            No internet connection.
        DiscordException
            If any exception was received from the Discord API.
        AssertionError
            If `channel` is not ``ChannelTextBase`` instance.
        
        Notes
        -----
        This method uses up to 4 different endpoint groups too as ``.message_delete_sequence``, but tries to

        ----------
        message : ``Message``, ``MessageRepr``, ``MessageReference``, `tuple` (`int`, `int`)
            The message to edit.
        content : `str`, ``EmbedBase`` or `Any`, Optional
            The new content of the message.
            
            If given as `str` then the message's content will be edited with it. If given as any non ``EmbedBase``
            instance, then it will be cased to string first.
            
            By passing it as empty string, you can remove the message's content.
            
            If given as ``EmbedBase`` instance, then the message's embeds will be edited with it.
        embed : `None`, ``EmbedBase`` instance or `list` of ``EmbedBase`` instances, Optional
            The new embedded content of the message. By passing it as `None`, you can remove the old.
            
            If `embed` and `content` parameters are both given as  ``EmbedBase`` instance, then `TypeError` is raised.
            
            If embeds are given as a list, then the first embed is picked up.
        allowed_mentions : `None`,  `str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role``, `list` of (`str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role`` ), Optional
            Which user or role can the message ping (or everyone). Check ``._parse_allowed_mentions``
            for details.
        suppress : `bool`, Optional
            Whether the message's embeds should be suppressed or unsuppressed.
        
        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            - If `embed` was given as `list`, but it contains not only ``EmbedBase`` instances.
            - If `allowed_mentions` contains an element of invalid type.
            - `content` parameter was given as ``EmbedBase`` instance, meanwhile `embed` parameter was given as well.
            - If `message`'s type is incorrect.
        ValueError
            If `allowed_mentions` contains an element of invalid type.
        ConnectionError
            No internet connection.
        DiscordException
            If any exception was received from the Discord API.
        AssertionError

            The webhook through what will the message be sent.
        content : `str`, ``EmbedBase``, `Any`, Optional
            The message's content if given. If given as `str` or empty string, then no content will be sent, meanwhile
            if any other non `str` or ``EmbedBase`` instance is given, then will be casted to string.

        embed : ``EmbedBase`` instance or `list` of ``EmbedBase`` instances, Optional
            The embedded content of the message.
            
            If `embed` and `content` parameters are both given as  ``EmbedBase`` instance, then `TypeError` is raised.
        file : `Any`, Optional
            A file or files to send. Check ``._create_file_form`` for details.
        allowed_mentions : `None`,  `str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role``, `list` of (`str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role`` ), Optional
            Which user or role can the message ping (or everyone). Check ``._parse_allowed_mentions`` for details.
        tts : `bool`, Optional
            Whether the message is text-to-speech.

            Returns `None` if there is nothing to send or if `wait` was given as `False` (so by default).
        
        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            - If `allowed_mentions` contains an element of invalid type.
            - If `embed` was given as `list`, but it contains not only ``EmbedBase`` instances.
            - `content` parameter was given as ``EmbedBase`` instance, meanwhile `embed` parameter was given as well.
            - If invalid file type would be sent.

            - If `allowed_mentions`'s elements' type is correct, but one of their value is invalid.
            - If more than `10` files would be sent.
        ConnectionError
            No internet connection.
        DiscordException
            If any exception was received from the Discord API.

        tts : `bool`, Optional

        file : `Any`, Optional
            A file or files to send. Check ``._create_file_form`` for details.
        embed : `None`, ``EmbedBase`` instance or `list` of ``EmbedBase`` instances, Optional
            The new embedded content of the message. By passing it as `None`, you can remove the old.
            
            If `embed` and `content` parameters are both given as  ``EmbedBase`` instance, then `TypeError` is raised.
        allowed_mentions : `None`,  `str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role``, `list` of (`str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role`` ), Optional
            Which user or role can the message ping (or everyone). Check ``._parse_allowed_mentions`` for details.

        ValueError
            If `allowed_mentions`'s elements' type is correct, but one of their value is invalid.
        ConnectionError
            No internet connection.

            if any other non `str` or ``EmbedBase`` instance is given, then will be casted to string.
            
            If given as ``EmbedBase`` instance, then is sent as the message's embed.
            
        embed : ``EmbedBase`` instance or `list` of ``EmbedBase`` instances, Optional
            The embedded content of the message.
            
            If `embed` and `content` parameters are both given as  ``EmbedBase`` instance, then `TypeError` is raised.
        file : `Any`, Optional
            A file to send. Check ``._create_file_form`` for details.
        allowed_mentions : `None`,  `str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role``, `list` of (`str`, ``UserBase``, ``Role`` ), Optional
            Which user or role can the message ping (or everyone). Check ``._parse_allowed_mentions`` for details.
        tts : `bool`, Optional
            Whether the message is text-to-speech. Defaults to `False`.
        show_for_invoking_user_only : `bool`, Optional
            Whether the sent message should only be shown to the invoking user. Defaults to `False`.
            
            If given as `True` only the message's content will be processed by Discord.

        ------
        TypeError
            - If `allowed_mentions` contains an element of invalid type.
            - If `embed` was given as `list`, but it contains not only ``EmbedBase`` instances.
