    """
    Represents a client what is joined to a voice channel.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    _audio_port : `int`
        The port, where the voice client should send the audio data.
    _audio_source : `int`
        An identifier sent by Discord what should be sent back with every voice packet.
    _audio_sources : `dict` of (`int`, `int`) items
        `user_id` - `audio_source` mapping used by ``AudioStream``-s.
    _audio_streams : `None` or `dict` of (`int`, (``AudioStream`` or (`list` of ``AudioStream``)) items
        `user_id` - ``AudioStream``(s) mapping for linking ``AudioStream`` to their respective user.
    _encoder : ``OpusEncoder``
        Encode not opus encoded audio data.
    _endpoint : `None` or `str`
        The endpoint, where the voice client sends the audio data.
    _endpoint_ip : `None` or `tuple` of `int`
        The ip version of the `._endpoint` attribute.
    _handshake_complete : ``Future``
        Used for awaiting the connecting handshake with Discord.
    _ip : `None` or `tuple` of `int`
        The ip to what the voice client's gateway connects.
    _port : `None` or `int`
        The port to what the voice client's gateway connects.
    _pref_volume : `float`
        The preferred volume of the voice client. can be between `0.0` and `2.0`.
    _protocol : `None` or ``DatagramMergerReadProtocol``
        Asynchronous protocol of the voice client to communicate with it's socket.
    _reconnecting : `bool`
        Whether the voice client plans to reconnect and it's reader and player should not be stopped.
    _secret_box : `None` or `nacl.secret.SecretBox`
        Data encoder of the voice client.
    _sequence : `int`
        Counter to define the sent data's sequence for Discord.
    _session_id : `None` or `str`
        The session id of the voice client's owner client's shard.
    _set_speaking_task : `None` or ``Task``
        Synchronization task for the `.set_speaking` coroutine.
    _socket : `None` or `socket.socket`
        The socket through what the ``VoiceClient`` sends the voice data to Discord. Created by the ``._create_socket``
        method, when the client's gateway receives response after connecting. If the client leaves the voice channel,
        then the socket is closed and set back to `None`.
    _timestamp : `int`
        A timestamp identifier to tell Discord how much frames we sent to it.
    _token : `str`
        Token received by the voice client's owner client's gateway. Used to authorize the voice client.
    _transport : `None` or ``_SelectorDatagramTransport``
        Asynchronous transport of the voice client to communicate with it's socket.
    _video_source : `int`
        An identifier sent by Discord what should be sent back with every video packet.
    _video_sources : `dict` of (`int`, `int`) items
        `user_id` - `video_source` mapping. Not used for now.
    call_after : `callable` (`awaitable`)
        A coroutine function what is awaited, when the voice clients's current audio finishes playing. By default
        this attribute is set to the ``._play_next`` function of the voice client (plays the next audio at the voice
        clients's ``.queue`` as expected.
        
        This attribute of the client can be modified freely. To it `2` parameters are passed:
         +------------------+---------------------------+
         | Respective name  | Type                      |
         +==================+===========================+
         | client           | ``VoiceClient``           |
         +------------------+---------------------------+
         | last_source      | `None` or ``AudioSource`` |
         +------------------+---------------------------+
         
         The ``VoiceClient`` also includes some other predefined function for setting as `call_after`:
         - ``._play_next``
         - ``._loop_actual``
         - ``._loop_queue``
     
    channel : ``ChannelVoice``
        The channel where the voice client currently is.
    client : ``Client``
        The voice client's owner client.
    connected : ``Event``
        Used to communicate with the ``AudioPlayer`` thread.
    gateway : ``DiscordGatewayVoice``
        The gateway through what the voice client communicates with Discord.
    guild : ``Guild``
        The guild where the voice client is.
    lock : `Lock`
        A lock used meanwhile changing the currently playing audio to not modifying it parallelly.
    player : ``AudioPlayer``
        The actual player of the ``VoiceClient``. If the voice client is not playing nor paused, then set as `None`.
    queue : `list` of ``AudioSource`` instances
        A list of the scheduled audios.
    reader : `None` or ``AudioReader``
        Meanwhile the received audio is collected, this attribute is set to a running ``AudioReader`` instance.
    region : ``VoiceRegion``
        The actual voice region of the voice client.
    speaking : `int`
        Whether the client is showed by Discord as `speaking`, then this attribute should is set as `1`. Can be
        modified, with the ``.set_speaking``, however it is always adjusted to the voice client's current playing state.
